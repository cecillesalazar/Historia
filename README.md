Historia is a collection of stories from a myriad of cultures which allows the user to make choices that determine the future plot and endings of the story.

How To Play:

1. Create a username and password to log in.
2. Click "Play" to generate a random story.
3. Click "Save" to save your progress.
4. Click "Load" to load your saved progress.
5. Click "Restart" to return to the beginning of the story.
6. Click "Play Again" to play another random story.
7. Click "Back to Dashboard" to return to the dashboard.
8. When given more than one option, make a choice.

A Few Pointers:
1. You may only save, load, and restart at beginning of chapters.
2. You only have one saved state. Saving more than once will overwrite your previous save.
3. Restart will take you from the beginning of the STORY, not the current chapter.

A Note About Current & Future Functionalities

The following may be expected in future updates:

1. Restart button resets the chapter, not the entire story.
2. Multiple saved states for users.
3. Allow users to create, add, and play their own stories - exclusively only for their account.

The following are desired updates that are difficult to tackle with daily life/work, so feel free to submit a pull request or reach out to me if you'd like to collaborate or have other ideas!

1. Add more stories: Currently there is only one story. In order to add more, there is a need for a script from a story that is pre-copyright/public domain and art (also either copyright free or with a purchased license).
2. A decision tree graphic displaying routes of every choice that users have made for all the stories they have played, with teasers on routes they have not yet explored.
3. Allow sharing of stories from user to user.

Please enjoy the game :)
